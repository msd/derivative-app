# Derivatives Trading App (demo)
A web application that will be used to input derivative trades, which will be
checked using  machine learning for any obvious mistakes (based on the trading
history of that item).

The back end runs on Python and Django, the front end is React, and the
artificial intelligence component is done in Python using Tensorflow.

Completed as a group project.
